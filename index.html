Diode

In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance to the flow of current in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals.
 Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold voltage or cut-in voltage is present in the forward direction (a state in which the diode is said to be forward-biased).
A semiconductor diode's current–voltage characteristic can be tailored by selecting the semiconductor materials and the doping impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture.

Light Emitting Diod
 

Photo Diode
 
p–n junction diode
A p–n junction diode is made of a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region on the other side that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, 

 

Reverse bias
If an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless electron–hole pairs are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see photodiode). This is called the reverse bias phenomenon.

Forward bias
However, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the p–n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be "turned on" as it has been given an external forward bias.

Shockley diode equation[edit]
Main article: Shockley diode equation
The Shockley ideal diode equation or the diode law (named after transistor co-inventor William Bradford Shockley) gives the I–V characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no bias). The following equation is called the Shockley ideal diode equation when n, the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :
   
where
I is the diode current,
Io is the reverse bias saturation current (or scale current),
VD is the voltage across the diode,
VT is the thermal voltage, and
n is the ideality factor, also known as the quality factor or sometimes emission coefficient.
The thermal voltage VT is approximately 25.85 mV at 300 K, a temperature close to "room temperature" commonly used in device simulation software. At any temperature it is a known constant defined by:
 VT =kT/q
where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature of the p–n junction, and q is the magnitude of charge of an electron


Half-wave rectification
In half-wave rectification of a single-phase supply, either the positive or negative half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.

  
 


Full-wave rectification[edit]
A full-wave rectifier converts the whole of the input waveform to one of constant polarity (positive or negative) at its output. Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC (direct current), and yields a higher average output voltage. Two diodes and a center tapped transformer, or four diodes in a bridge configurationand any AC source (including a transformer without center tap), are needed.[3] Single semiconductor diodes, double diodes with common cathode or common anode, and four-diode bridges, are manufactured as single components.
 

 


Diode in reverse breakdown region
Diode in reverse breakdown region is called Zener diode and used in voltage regulator
Transistor
A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power

 

There are two types of transistors, which have slight differences in how they are used in a circuit. A bipolar transistor has terminals labeled base, collector, and emitter. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. For a field-effect transistor, the terminals are labeled gate, source, and drain, and a voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.

BJT: The basic function of a BJT is to amplify current

Real Power in AC Circuits
Real power P, also known as true or active power, performs the “real work” within an electrical circuit. Real power, measured in watts, defines the power consumed by the resistive part of a circuit. Then real power, P in an AC circuit is the same as power, P in a DC circuit. So just like DC circuits, it is always calculated as I2R, where R is the total resistive component of the circuit.



 
Transducer: the signal must first be converted into an electric signal, that is, a voltage or a current. This process is accomplished by devices known as transducers.

Amplifier
Their purpose is to make the signal magnitude larger and therefore are thought of as
voltage amplifiers

the power amplifier.
Such an amplifier may provide only a modest amount of voltage gain but substantial current
gain.


An amplifier increases the signal power, an important feature that distinguishes an amplifier
from a transformer.

A negative gain Av simply means that there is a 1800 phase difference between input and output signals; it does not imply that the amplifier is attenuating the signal

the question arises as to the source of this additional power. The answer is found by observing
that amplifiers need dc power supplies for their operation. These dc sources supply the
extra power delivered to the load as well as any power that might be dissipated in the internal
circuit of the amplifier

the dc power delivered to the amplifier is
Pdc == V1/I1 + V2/I2

If the power dissipated in the amplifier circuit is denoted Pdissipated' the power-balance equation
for the amplifier can be written as
 
 Pdc + PI == PL + Pdissipated
	

Operational amplifier
 

The amplifier's differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+) with voltage V+ and an inverting input (–) with voltage V−; ideally the op-amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two, which is called the differential input voltage. The output voltage of the op-amp Vout is given by the equation:
 
where AOL is the open-loop gain of the amplifier (the term "open-loop" refers to the absence of a feedback loop from the output to the input).

 
Figure: An equivalent circuit of an operational amplifier that models some resistive non-ideal parameters.


Transformer
The Voltage Transformer can be thought of as an electrical component rather than an electronic component. A transformer basically is very simple static (or stationary) electro-magnetic passive electrical device that works on the principle of Faraday’s law of induction by converting electrical energy from one value to another.
A single phase voltage transformer basically consists of two electrical coils of wire, one called the “Primary Winding” and another called the “Secondary Winding”. 

These two coils are not in electrical contact with each other but are instead wrapped together around a common closed magnetic iron circuit called the “core”.

http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transformer/transformer-basics.html


As the magnetic flux varies sinusoidally, Φ = Φmax sinωt, then the basic relationship between induced emf, ( E ) in a coil winding of N turns is given by:
emf = turns x rate of change
 


In an ideal transformer (ignoring any losses), the power available in the secondary winding will be the same as the power in the primary winding, they are constant wattage devices and do not change the power only the voltage to current ratio. Thus, in an ideal transformer the Power Ratio is equal to one (unity) as the voltage, V multiplied by the current, I will remain constant.
That is the electric power at one voltage/current level on the primary is “transformed” into electric power, at the same frequency, to the same voltage/current level on the secondary side. Although the transformer can step-up (or step-down) voltage, it cannot step-up power. Thus, when a transformer steps-up a voltage, it steps-down the current and vice-versa, so that the output power is always at the same value as the input power. Then we can say that primary power equals secondary power, ( PP = PS ).

Resistor
 
Electrical conductivity = σ = 1/ρ	

Inductor
an inductor can be defined as an energy storage device which stores energy in form of magnetic field

An inductor is about as simple as an electronic component can get -- it is simply a coil of wire. It turns out, however, that a coil of wire can do some very interesting things because of the magnetic properties of a coil.

 

capacitor
a device used to store an electric charge, consisting of one or more pairs of conductors separated by an insulator.
 

A capacitor's storage potential, or capacitance, is measured in units called farads. A 1-farad capacitor can store one coulomb (coo-lomb) of charge at 1 volt. 

a)	Capacitance: The amount of charge that can be stored inside a capacitor at a given voltage is called Capacitance. It gets charged when charges are forced into the positive (or upper) plate of the capacitor due to emf. Similarly, it discharged when charges are forcefully pulled out of the capacitor. Capacitance is measured in Farad.

b) Inductance: It is the property of a coil to resist any change in electric current flowing through it. Self inductance is caused when a coil resists the current change through itself. Mutual inductance occurs when a secondary coil opposes current change in a primary coil. Inductance is measured in Henry.

c) Resistance: It is the property of a material which opposes the flow of electric current through it. Conductors have low resistance while insulators have very high resistance. It is measured in Ohms.

What are the resistor, capacitor, inductor, diode and transistor? What do they do in an electric circuit?

https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-resistor-capacitor-inductor-diode-and-transistor-What-do-they-do-in-an-electric-circuit
Equate a transistor to a water valve.  Apply a little signal at the knob, control the flow of water through the tap.

A capacitor can be compared to a Water Bottle Rocket.  You can pump up water into the bottle and build pressure, but if the pressure goes too high the bottle will split.  If you release the pressure suddenly, you get a LOT of high-speed water out, so what a capacitor does is store pressure (voltage). 

A resistor can be compared to a restriction in the flow of water through a hose - kink the hose enough, and you can shut off the flow.  Or, just stick a washer with a hole in the hose, and restrict the flow a fixed amount.  So a resistor restricts flow.

A diode is a flapper valve.  It only allows water to flow in one direction, and closes when the flow reverses.  (And a thyristor is a diode with a controllable flapper.  YOU can decide whether or not it can open, but once it's open, it stays that way until the flow reverses.  A Zener diode is a flapper valve with a spring on it that resists opening until the pressure on it gets high enough to force it open.)

An inductor is a harder thing to explain.  While a capacitor stores charge, or "pressure," an inductor stores magnetic flux.  The best characterization - sticking with hydraulics - is an open-topped storage tank with a drain pipe at the bottom.  The size of the drain pipe controls the maximum flow rate (impedance), so if more flow goes into the tank than can flow out of the drain, the level in the tank builds up.  Then, even if the inflow stops, the output will continue until the tank is empty.  This isn't perfect, but it gets the general idea across.  

None of these are perfect analogies, but they do get the basic ideas across.

Superposition Theorem
http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/resources/knowledge/theorems-and-laws/superposition-theorem
The strategy used in the Superposition Theorem is to eliminate all but one source of power within a network at a time, using series/parallel analysis to determine voltage drops (and/or currents) within the modified network for each power source separately. Then, once voltage drops and/or currents have been determined for each power source working separately, the values are all “superimposed” on top of each other (added algebraically) to find the actual voltage drops/currents with all sources active. 
•	The Superposition Theorem states that a circuit can be analyzed with only one source of power at a time, the corresponding component voltages and currents algebraically added to find out what they’ll do with all power sources in effect.
•	To negate all but one power source for analysis, replace any source of voltage (batteries) with a wire; replace any current source with an open (break).


 it only works where the underlying equations are linear (no mathematical powers or roots). The requisite of linearity means that Superposition Theorem is only applicable for determining voltage and current, not power!!!Power dissipations, being nonlinear functions, do not algebraically add to an accurate total when only one source is considered at a time. The need for linearity also means this Theorem cannot be applied in circuits where the resistance of a component changes with voltage or current. Hence, networks containing components like lamps (incandescent or gas-discharge) or varistors could not be analyzed.
Another prerequisite for Superposition Theorem is that all components must be “bilateral,” meaning that they behave the same with electrons flowing either direction through them.

Analog & digital Modulation
http://www.equestionanswers.com/notes/modulation-analog-digital.php

Modulation:
Now we have to develop some way to send the information of message signal via this carrier signal. The carrier signal is a high frequency sinusoidal signal represented by amplitude, frequency and phase. We can vary one of this parameter accordingly with the message information.
Definition: Operation of varying amplitude, frequency or phase of carrier signal accordingly with the instantaneous amplitude of the message signal is called modulation. 
 
Here baseband signals comes from a audio/video or computer. Baseband signals are also called modulating signal as it modulates carrir signal. career signals are high frequecy radio waves it generally comes from a radio frequency oscillators. These two signls are combined in modulator. Modulator takes the instantenious amplitute of baseband signal and varies amplitute/frequency/phase of career signal. Resultant signal is a modulated signal. It goes to an RF-amplifier for signal power boosting and then feed to antenna or a co-axial cable.
There are two types of modulation analog and digital. Analog modulation delas with the voice, video and regular waves of base band signals. Where as digital modulations are with bit streams or symbols from computing vevices as base band signals.
DeModulation:
Demodulation is the opposite process of modulation. Modulator is a part of signal transmitter where as demodulator is the receiving side. In broadcast system radio tranmitting station does to modulation part. A radio receiver acts as a demodulator. A modem receives signals and also transmits signals thus it does modulation and demodulation at the same time. Thus the name modem has been given. A radio antenna receives low power signal. A co-axial cable end point can also taken as an signal input. An RF amplifer boosts the signal amplitude. Then the signal goes to a demodulator. demodulator does the reverse of modulation and extracts the backband signal from career. Then the base band signal is amplified to feed a audio speaker or video moitor or TTL/CMOS signal levels to match computer inpts.
 
Analog Modulation:
Baseband signal is always analog for this modulation. There are three properties of a carrier signal amplitute, frequency and phase thus there are three basic types of analog modulations.
1.	Amplitude Modulation (AM)
2.	Frequency Modulation (FM)
3.	Phase modulation (PM)
Amplitute Modulation
Amplitude modulation or AM is the process of varying the instantaneous amplitude of carrier signal accordingly with instantaneous amplitude of message signal. Thus, if m(t) is the message signal and c(t)=Acoswct then AM signal F(t) is written as
F(t)= Acoswct+m(t) coswct
F(t)=[A+m(t)] coswct
 
 
AM Advantage
AM is the simplest type of modulation. Hardware design of both transmitter and receiver is very simple and less cost effective.
AM Disadvange:
AM is very susceptible to noise.
Application:
1) AM radio broad cast is an example
Frequency modulation
FM:-FM or Frequency modulation is the process of varying the in instantaneous frequency of Carrier signal accordingly with instantaneous amplitude of message signal. Thus, if m(t) is the message signal and c(t)=Acoswct then FM signal will be 
F(t)= Acos(wc t+kf ∫m(α)dα)
 
 
FM Advantage
Modulation and demodulation does not catch any channel noise.
FM Disadvange:
Circuit needed for FM modulation and demodulation is bit complicated than AM
Application:
1) FM radio broad cast is an example
Phase modulation (PM)
PM or Phase modulation is the process of varying the instantaneous phase of Carrier signal accordingly with instantaneous amplitude of message signal. Thus if m(t) is the message signal and c(t)=Acoswct then PM signal will be 
F(t)= Acos(wct+kpm(t))
  
 
PM Advantage
Modulation and demodulation does not catch any channel noise.
PM Disadvange:
Circuit needed for PM modulation and demodulation is bit complicated than AM and FM
Application:
1) Satellite communication.
Digital modulation:
 
Digital modulation in somewhat similar to the analog modulation except base band signal is of discrete amplitude level. For binary signal it has only two level, either high or logic 1 or low or logic 0. The modulation scheme is mainly three types.
 
1.	ASK or Amplitude shift Key
2.	FSK or Frequency shift key
3.	PSK or Phase shift key
ASK or Amplitude shift Key:
 When the carrier amplitude is varied in proportion to message signal m(t). We have the modulated carrier m(t)coswct where coswct is the carrier signal. As the information is an on-off signal the output is also an on-off signal where the carrier is present when information is 1 and carrier is absent when information is 0. Thus this modulation scheme is known as on-off keying (OOK) or amplitude shift key.
 
Application:
1.	Used in our infrared remote controls
2.	Used in fibre optical tranmitter and receiver.
FSK or Frequency shift key:
When Data are transmitted by varying frequency of the carrier, we have the case of frequency shift key. In this modulation carrier has two predefined frequency wc1 and wc2. When information bit is 1 carrier with wc1 is transmitted i.e. coswc1 and When information bit is 0 carrier with wc0 is transmitted i.e. coswc0
 
Application:
1.	Many modems used FSK in telemetry systems
PSK or Phase shift key:
The phase of the carrier is shifted for this modulation. If the base band signal m(t) =1 carrier in phase is transmitted. If m(t)=0 carrier with out of phase is transmitted i.e. cos(wct+П). If phase shift is done in 4 different quadrants then 2bit of information can be sent at a time. This scheme is a special case of PSK modulation known as QPSK or Quadrature Phase Shift Key.
 
Application:
1.	Used in our ADSL broadband modem
2.	Used in satellite communication
3.	Used in our mobile phones



Block Diagrams of Control System
http://www.electrical4u.com/block-diagrams-of-control-system/
The block diagram is to represent a control system in diagram form. In other words practical representation of a control system is its block diagram. It is not always convenient to derive the entire transfer function of a complex control system in a single function. It is easier and better to derive transfer function of control element connected to the system, separately. The transfer function of each element is then represented by a block and they are then connected together with the path of signal flow. For simplifying a complex control system, block diagrams are used. Each element of the control system is represented with a block and the block is the symbolic representation of transfer function of that element. A complete control system can be represented with a required number of interconnected such blocks. In the figure below, there are two elements with transfer function Gone(s) and Gtwo(s). Where Gone(s) is the transfer function of first element and Gtwo(s) is the transfer function of second element of the system. 
In addition to that, the diagram also shows there is a feedback path through which output signal C(s) is fed back and compared with the input R(s) and the difference between input and output E(s) = R(s) – C(s) is acting as actuating signal or error signal.


  


In each block of diagram, the output and input are related together by transfer function. Where, transfer function

  

where, C(s) is the output and R(s) is the input of that particular block.

  

A complex control system consists of several blocks. Each of them has its own transfer function. But overall transfer function of the system is the ratio of transfer function of final output to transfer function of initial input of the system. This overall transfer function of the system can be obtained by simplifying the control system by combining this individual blocks, one by one. Technique of combining of these blocks is referred as block diagram reduction technique. For successful implementation of this technique, some rules for block diagram reduction to be followed. Let us discuss these rules, one by one for reduction of block diagram of control system.
If the transfer function of input of control system is R(s) and corresponding output is C(s), and the overall transfer function of the control system is G(s), then the control system can be represented as 

  
Take off Point of Block Diagram


when we need to apply one or same input to more than one blocks, we use take off point. A point is where the input gets more than one paths to propagate. This to be noted that the input does not get divided at a point, hence input propagates through all the paths connected to that point without affecting its value. Hence, by take off point same input signals can be applied to more than one systems or blocks. Representation of a common input signal to more than one blocks of control system is done by a common point as shown in the figure below with point X. 
 
Cascade Blocks
When several systems or control blocks are connected in cascaded manner, the transfer function of the entire system will be the product of transfer function of all individual blocks. Here it also to be remembered that the output of any block will not be affected by the presence of other blocks in the cascaded system. 

 

Now, from the diagram it is seen that, 
 

Where, G(s) is the overall transfer function of cascaded control system.
  
Summing Point of Block Diagram


Instead of applying single input signal to different blocks as in the previous case, there may be such situation where different input signals are applied to same block. Here, resultant input signal is the summation of all input signals applied. Summation of input signals is represented by a point called summing point which is shown in the figure below by crossed circle. Here R(s), X(s) and Y(s) are the input signals. It is necessary to indicate the fine specifying the input signal entering a summing point in the block diagram of control system.

  
Consecutive Summing Point

A summing point with more than two inputs can be divided into two or more consecutive summing points, where alteration of the position of consecutive summing points does not effect the output of the signal. In other words - if there are more than one summing points directly inter associated, then they can be easily interchanged from their position without affecting the final output of the summing system.

  


 

Parallel Blocks
When same input signal is applied different blocks and the output from each of them are added in a summing point for taking final output of the system then over all transfer function of the system will be the algebraic sum of transfer function of all individual blocks.
  

If Cone, Ctwo and Cthree are the outputs of the blocks with transfer function G one, Gtwo and Gthree, then 
 

 

Shifting of Take off Point
If same signal is applied to more than one system, then the signal is represented in the system by a point called take off point. Principle of shifting of take off point is that, it may be shifted either side of a block but final output of the branches connected to the take off point must be un-changed. The take off point can be shifted either sides of the block.

  

In the figure above the take off point is shifted from position A to B. The signal R(s) at take off point A will become G(s)R(s) at point B. Hence another block of inverse of transfer function G(s) is to be put on that path to get R(s) again.

  

Now let us examine the situation when take off point is shifted before the block which was previously after the block.  

Here the output is C(s) and input is R(s) and hence   

Here, we have to put one block of transfer function G(s) on the path so that output again comes as C(s). 

 
Shifting of Summing Point
Let us examine the shifting of summing point from a position before a block to a position after a block. There are two input signals R(s) and ±X(s) entering in a summing point at position A. The output of the summing point is R(s) ± X(s). The resultant signal is the input of a control system block of transfer function G(s) and the final output of the system is 

 

 
Hence, a summing point can be redrawn with input signals R(s)G(s) and ± X(s)G(s) 
 

 

In the above block diagrams of control system output can be rewritten as

  

The above equation can be represented by a block of transfer function G(s) and input R(s)±X(s)/G(s) again R(s)±X(s)/G(s) can be represented with a summing point of input signal R(s) and ±X(s)/G(s) and finally it can be drawn as below. 
 

Block Diagram of Closed Loop Control System

 

In a closed loop control system, a fraction of output is fed-back and added to input of the system. If H (s) is the transfer function of feedback path, then the transfer function of feedback signal will be B(s) = C(s)H(s). At summing point, the input signal R(s) will be added to B(s) and produces actual input signal or error signal of the system and it is denoted by E(s). 
   

 


Power in AC Circuits
http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/accircuits/power-in-ac-circuits.html

Home / AC Circuits / Power in AC Circuits
 
Power in AC Circuits
In a direct current circuit, the power consumed is simply the product of the dc voltage times the DC current, VxI and is measured in watts. However, we cannot calculate it in a similar manner for reactive AC circuits.

Electrical power is the “rate” at which energy is being consumed in a circuit and as such all electrical and electronic components and devices have a limit to the amount of electrical power that they can safely handle. For example, a 1/4 watt resistor or a 20 watt amplifier.
Electrical power can be time-varying either as a DC quantity or as an AC quantity. The amount of power in a circuit at any instant of time is called the instantaneous power and is given by the well-known relationship of P = VI. So one watt (which is the rate of expending energy at one joule per second) will be equal to the volt-ampere product of one volt times one ampere.
Then the power absorbed or supplied by a circuit element is the product of the voltage, V across the element, and the current, I flowing through it. So if we had a DC circuit with a resistance of “R” ohms, the power dissipated by the resistor in watts is given by any of the following generalised formulas:
Electrical Power
 
 
Where: V is the dc voltage, I is the dc current and R is the value of the resistance.
So power within an electrical circuit is only present when both the voltage and current are present, that is no open-circuit or closed-circuit conditions. Consider the following simple example of a standard resistive dc circuit:
DC Resistive Circuit
 
Electrical Power in an AC Circuit
In a DC circuit, the voltages and currents are generally constant, that is not varying with time as there is no sinusoidal waveform associated with the supply. However in an AC circuit, the instantaneous values of the voltage, current and therefore power are constantly changing being influenced by the supply. So we cannot calculate the power in AC circuits in the same manner as we can in DC circuits, but we can still say that power (p) is equal to the voltage (v) times the amperes (i).
Another important point is that AC circuits contain reactance, so there is a power component as a result of the magnetic and/or electric fields created by the components. The result is that unlike a purely resistive component, this power is not only consumed but instead is stored and then returned back to the supply as the sinusoidal waveform goes through one complete periodic cycle.
Thus, the average power absorbed by a circuit is the sum of the power stored and the power returned over one complete cycle. So a circuits average power consumption will be the average of the instantaneous power over one full cycle with the instantaneous power, p defined as the multiplication of the instantaneous voltage, v by the instantaneous current, i. Note that as the sine function is periodic and continuous, the average power given over all time will be exactly the same as the average power given over a single cycle.
Let us assume that the waveforms of the voltage and current are both sinusoidal, so we recall that:
Sinusoidal Voltage Waveform
 
 
As the instantaneous power is the power at any instant of time, then:
 
 
Applying the trigonometric product-to-sum identity of:
 
 
and θ = θv – θi (the phase difference between the voltage and the current waveforms) into the above equation gives:
 
 
Where V and I are the root-mean-squared (rms) values of the sinusoidal waveforms, v  and i respectively, and θ is the phase difference between the two waveforms. Therefore we can express the instantaneous power as being:
Instantaneous AC Power Equation
 
 
This equation shows us that the instantaneous AC power has two different parts and is therefore the sum of these two terms. The second term is a time varying sinusoid whose frequency is equal to twice the angular frequency of the supply due to the 2ω part of the term. The first term however is a constant whose value depends only on the phase difference, θ between the voltage, (V) and the current, (I).
As the instantaneous power is constantly changing with the profile of the sinusoid over time, this makes it difficult to measure. It is therefore more convenient, and easier on the maths to use the average or mean value of the power. So over a fixed number of cycles, the average value of the instantaneous power of the sinusoid is given simply as:
 
 
where V and I are the sinusoids rms values, and θ (Theta) is the phase angle between the voltage and the current. The units of power are in watts (W).
The AC Power dissipated in a circuit can also be found from the impedance, Z of the circuit using the voltage, Vrms or the current, Irms flowing through the circuit as shown.
 
AC Power Example No1
The voltage and current values of a 50Hz sinusoidal supply are given as: vt = 240 sin(ωt +60o)Volts and it = 5 sin(ωt -10o)Amps respectively. Find the values of the instantaneous power and the average power absorbed by the circuit.
From above, the instantaneous power absorbed by the circuit is given as:
 
 
Applying the trigonometric identity rule from above gives:
 
 
The average power is then calculated as:
 
 
You may have noticed that the average power value of 205.2 watts is also the first term value of the instantaneous power p(t) as this first term constant value is the average or mean rate of energy change between the source and load.
AC Power in a Purely Resistive Circuit
We have seen thus far, that in a dc circuit, power is equal to the product of voltage and current and this relationship is also true for a purely resistive AC circuit. Resistors are electrical devices that consume energy and the power in a resistor is given by p = VI = I2R = V2/R. This power is always positive.
Consider the following purely resistive (that is infinite capacitance, C = ∞ and zero inductance, L = 0) circuit with a resistor connected to an AC supply, as shown.
Purely Resistive Circuit
 
 
When a pure resistor is connected to a sinusoidal voltage supply, the current flowing through the resistor will vary in proportion to the supply voltage, that is the voltage and current waveforms are “in-phase” with each other. Since the phase difference between the voltage waveform and the current waveform is 0o, the phase angle resulting in cos 0o will be equal to 1.
Then the electrical power consumed by the resistor is given by:
Electrical Power in a Pure Resistor
 
 
As the voltage and current waveforms are in-phase, that is both waveforms reach their peak values at the same time, and also pass through zero at the same time, the power equation above reduces down to just VxI. Therefore the the power at any instant can be found by multiplying together the two waveforms to give the volt-ampere product. This is called the “Real Power”, (P) measured in watts, (W), Kilowatt (kW), Megawatt (MW), etc.
AC Power Waveforms for a Pure Resistor
 
 
The diagram shows the voltage, current and corresponding power waveforms. As the voltage and current waveforms are both in-phase, during the positive half-cycle, when the voltage is positive, the current is also positive so the power is positive, as a positive times a positive equals a positive. During the negative half-cycle, the voltage in negative, so to is the current resulting in the power being positive, as a negative times a negative equals a positive.
Then in a purely resistive circuit, electrical power is consumed ALL the time that current is flowing through the resistor and is given as: P = VxI = I2R watts. Note that both V and I can be their rms values where: V = IxR and I = V/R.
AC Power in a Purely Inductive Circuit
In a purely inductive (that is infinite capacitance, C = ∞ and zero resistance, R = 0) circuit of L henries, the voltage and current waveforms are not in-phase. Whenever a changing voltage is applied to a purely inductive coil, a “back” emf is produced by the coil due to its self-inductance. This self-inductance opposes and limits any changes to the current flowing in the coil.
The effects of this back emf is that the current cannot increase immediately through the coil in-phase with the applied voltage causing the current waveform to reach its peak or maximum value some time after that of the voltage. The result is that in a purely inductive circuit, the current always “lags” (ELI) behind the voltage by 90o (ω/2) as shown.
Purely Inductive Circuit
 
 
The waveforms above shows us the instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current across a purely inductive coil as a function of time. Maximum current, Im occurs at one full quarter of a cycle (90o) after the maximum (peak) value of the voltage. Here the current is shown with its negative maximum value at the start of the voltage cycle and passes through zero increasing to its positive maximum value when the voltage waveform is at its maximum value at 90o.
Thus as the voltage and current waveforms are no longer rising and falling together, but instead a phase shift of 90o (ω/2) is introduced in the coil, then the voltage and current waveforms are “out-of-phase” with each other as the voltage leads the current by 90o. Since the phase difference between the voltage waveform and the current waveform is 90o, then the phase angle resulting in cos 90o = 0.
Therefore the electrical power consumed by a pure inductor, QL is given by:
Real Power in a Pure Inductor
 
 
Clearly then, a pure inductor does not consume or dissipate any real or true power, but as we have both voltage and current the use of cosθ in the expression: P = IVcosθ for a pure inductor is no longer valid. The product of the current and the voltage in this case is imaginary power, commonly called “Reactive Power”, (Q) measured in voltamperes reactive, (VAr), Kilo-voltamperes reactive (KVAr), etc.
Voltamperes reactive, VAr should not be confused with watts, W which is used for real power. VAr represents the product of the volts and amperes that are 90o out-of-phase with each other. To identify the reactive average power mathematically, the sine function is used. Then the equation for the average reactive power in an inductor becomes:
Reactive Power in a Pure Inductor
 
 
Like real power, P, reactive power, Q also depends on voltage and current, but also the phase angle between them. It is therefore the product of the applied voltage and the component part of the current which is 90o out-of-phase with the voltage as shown.
AC Power Waveforms for a Pure Inductor
 
 
In the positive half of the voltage waveform between the angle of 0o and 90o, the inductor current is negative while the supply voltage is positive. Therefore, the volts and ampere product gives a negative power as a negative times a positive equals a negative. Between 90o and 180o, both current and voltage waveforms are positive in value resulting in positive power. This positive power indicates that the coil is consuming electrical energy from the supply.
In the negative half of the voltage waveform between 180o and 270o, there is a negative voltage and positive current indicating a negative power. This negative power indicates that the coil is returning the stored electrical energy back to the supply. Between 270oand 360o, both the inductors current and the supply voltage are both negative resulting in a period of positive power.
Then during one full-cycle of the voltage waveform we have two identical positive and negative pulses of power whose average value is zero so no real power is used up since the power alternately flows to and from the source. This means then that the total power taken by a pure inductor over one full-cycle is zero, so an inductors reactive power does not perform any real work.
AC Power in a Purely Capacitive Circuit
A purely capacitive (that is zero inductance, L = 0 and infinite resistance, R = ∞) circuit of C Farads, has the property of delaying changes in the voltage across it. Capacitors store electrical energy in the form of an electric field within the dielectric so a pure capacitor does not dissipate any energy but instead stores it.
In a purely capacitive circuit the voltage cannot increase in-phase with the current as it needs to “charge-up” the capacitors plates first. This causes the voltage waveform to reach its peak or maximum value some time after that of the current. The result is that in a purely capacitive circuit, the current always “leads” (ICE) the voltage by 90o (ω/2) as shown.
Purely Capacitive Circuit
 
 
The waveform shows us the voltage and current across a pure capacitor as a function of time. Maximum current, Im occurs a one full quarter of a cycle (90o) before the maximum (peak) value of the voltage. Here the current is shown with its positive maximum value at the start of the voltage cycle and passes through zero, decreasing to its negative maximum value when the voltage waveform is at its maximum value at 90o. The opposite phase shift to the purely inductive circuit.
Thus for a purely capacitive circuit, the phase angle θ = -90o and the equation for the average reactive power in a capacitor becomes:
Reactive Power in a Pure Capacitor
 
 
Where -VIsinθ is a negative sine wave. Also the symbol for capacitive reactive power is QC with the same unit of measure, the voltampere reactive (VAR) as that of the inductor. Then we can see that just like a purely inductive circuit above, a pure capacitor does not consume or dissipate any real or true power, P.
AC Power Waveforms for a Pure Capacitor
 
 
In the positive half of the voltage waveform between the angle of 0o and 90o, both the current and voltage waveforms are positive in value resulting in positive power being consumed. Between 90o and 180o, the capacitor current is negative and the supply voltage is still positive. Therefore, the voltampere product gives a negative power as a negative times a positive equals a negative. This negative power indicates that the coil is returning stored electrical energy back to the supply.
In the negative half of the voltage waveform between 180o and 270o, both the capacitors current and the supply voltage are negative in value resulting in a period of positive power. This period of positive power indicates that the coil is consuming electrical energy from the supply. Between 270o and 360o, there is a negative voltage and positive current indicating once again a negative power.
Then during one full-cycle of the voltage waveform the same situation exists as for the purely inductive circuit in that we have two identical positive and negative pulses of power whose average value is zero. Thus the power delivered from the source to the capacitor is exactly equal to the power returned to the source by the capacitor so no real power is used up since the power alternately flows to and from the source. This means then that the total power taken by a pure capacitor over one full-cycle is zero, so the capacitors reactive power does not perform any real work.

AC Electrical Power Summary
We have seen here that in AC circuits, the voltage and current flowing in a purely passive circuit are normally out-of-phase and, as a result, they can not be used to accomplish any real work. We have also seen that in a direct current (DC) circuit, electrical power is equal to the voltage times the current, or P = VxI, but we can not calculate it in the same manner as for AC circuits as we need to take into account any phase difference.
In a purely resistive circuit, the current and voltage are both in-phase and all the electrical power is consumed by the resistance, usually as heat. As a result, none of the electrical power is returned back to the source supply or circuit.
However, in a purely inductive or a purely capacitive circuit that contains reactance, (X) the current will lead or lag the voltage by exactly 90o (the phase angle) so power is both consumed and returned back to the source with the average power calculated over one full periodic cycle being equal to zero.
The electrical power consumed by a resistance, (R) is called the true or real power and is simply obtained by multiplying the rms voltage with the rms current. The power consumed by a reactance, (X) is called the reactive power and is obtained by multiplying the voltage, current, and the sine of the phase angle between them.
The symbol for phase angle is θ (Theta) and which represents the inefficiency of the AC circuit with regards to the total reactive impedance (Z) that opposes the flow of current in the circuit.

Z = R + jX, for inductive reactance X
Z = R -jX, for capacitive reactance X

 Y = G – jB, for inductive susceptance B
Y = G+ jB, for capacitive susceptance B



Admittance (Y) is the inverse of impedance. Y=1/Z
Conductivity (G) is the inverse of resistance. G=1/R
Susceptance (B) is the inverse of reactance. B=1/X
As susceptance is the reciprocal of reactance, in an inductive circuit, inductive susceptance, BL will be negative in value and in a capacitive circuit, capacitive susceptance, BC will be positive in value. The exact opposite to XL and XC respectively.

Series Resonance Frequency
 
 You may also note that if the circuits impedance is at its minimum at resonance then consequently, the circuits admittance must be at its maximum and one of the characteristics of a series resonance circuit is that admittance is very high.

  
We recall from the previous tutorial about series RLC circuits that the voltage across a series combination is the phasor sum of VR, VL and VC. Then if at resonance the two reactances are equal and cancelling, the two voltages representing VL and VC must also be opposite and equal in value thereby cancelling each other out because with pure components the phasor voltages are drawn at +90o and -90o respectively.
Then in a series resonance circuit as VL = -VC the resulting reactive voltages are zero and all the supply voltage is dropped across the resistor. Therefore, VR = Vsupply and it is for this reason that series resonance circuits are known as voltage resonance circuits, (as opposed to parallel resonance circuits which are current resonance circuits).

Since the current flowing through a series resonance circuit is the product of voltage divided by impedance, at resonance the impedance, Z is at its minimum value, ( =R ). Therefore, the circuit current at this frequency will be at its maximum value of V/R as shown below.

How does an ordinary DC motor work?


http://www.explainthatstuff.com/induction-motors.html
The simple motors you see explained in science books are based on a piece of wire bent into a rectangular loop, which is suspended between the poles of a magnet. (Physicists would call this a current-carrying conductor sitting in a magnetic field.) When you hook up a wire like this to a battery, a direct current (DC) flows through it, producing a temporary magnetic field all around it. This temporary field repels the original field from the permanent magnet, causing the wire to flip over. Normally the wire would stop at that point and then flip back again, but if we use an ingenious, rotating connection called a commutator, we can make the current reverse every time the wire flips over, and that means the wire will keep rotating in the same direction for as long as the current keeps flowing. That's the essence of the simple DC electric motor, which was conceived in the 1820s by Michael Faraday and turned into a practical invention about a decade later by William Sturgeon. (You'll find more detail in our introductory article on electric motors.)
Before we move on to AC motors, let's quickly summarize what's going on here. In a DC motor, the magnet (and its magnetic field) is fixed in place and forms the outside, static part of the motor (the stator), while a coil of wire carrying the electric current forms the rotating part of the motor (the rotor). The magnetic field comes from the stator, which is a permanent magnet, while you feed the electric power to the coil that makes up the rotor. The interaction between the permanent magnetic field of the stator and the temporary magnetic field produced by the rotor is what makes the motor spin.
 


How does an AC motor work?
Unlike toys and flashlights, most homes, offices, factories, and other buildings aren't powered by little batteries: they're not supplied with DC current, but with alternating current (AC), which reverses its direction about 50 times per second (with a frequency of 50 Hz). If you want to run a motor from your household AC electricity supply, instead of from a DC battery, you need a different design of motor.
In an AC motor, there's a ring of electromagnets arranged around the outside (making up the stator), which are designed to produce a rotating magnetic field. Inside the stator, there's a solid metal axle, a loop of wire, a coil, a squirrel cage made of metal bars and interconnections (like the rotating cages people sometimes get to amuse pet mice), or some other freely rotating metal part that can conduct electricity. Unlike in a DC motor, where you send power to the inner rotor, in an AC motor you send power to the outer coils that make up the stator. The coils are energized in pairs, in sequence, producing a magnetic field that rotates around the outside of the motor.
How does this rotating field make the motor move? Remember that the rotor, suspended inside the magnetic field, is an electrical conductor. The magnetic field is constantly changing (because it's rotating) so, according to the laws of electromagnetism (Faraday's law, to be precise), the magnetic field produces (or induces, to use Faraday's own term) an electric current inside the rotor. If the conductor is a ring or a wire, the current flows around it in a loop. If the conductor is simply a solid piece of metal, eddy currentsswirl around it instead. Either way, the induced current produces its own magnetic field and, according to another law of electromagnetism  (Lenz's law) tries to stop whatever it is that causes it—the rotating magnetic field—by rotating as well. (You can think of the rotor frantically trying to "catch up" with the rotating magnetic field in an effort to eliminate the difference in motion between them.) Electromagnetic induction is the key to why a motor like this spins—and that's why it's called an induction motor.
How does an AC induction motor work?
 
Here's a little animation to summarize things and hopefully make it all clear:
1.	Two pairs of electromagnet coils, shown here in red and blue, are energized in turn by an AC supply (not shown, but coming in to the leads on the right). The two red coils are wired in series and energized together and the two blue coils are wired the same way. Since it's AC, the current in each coil doesn't switch on and off abruptly (as this animation suggests), but rises and falls smoothly in the shape of a sine wave: when the red coils are at their most active, the blue coils are completely inactive, and vice-versa. In other words, their currents are out of step (90° out of phase).
2.	As the coils are energized, the magnetic field they produce between them induces an electric current in the rotor. This current produces its own magnetic field that tries to oppose the thing that caused it (the magnetic field from the outer coils). The interaction between the two fields causes the rotor to turn.
3.	As the magnetic field alternates between the red and blue coils, it effectively rotates around the motor. The rotating magnetic field makes the rotor spin in the same direction and (in theory) at almost the same speed.
Electricity generators
http://www.explainthatstuff.com/generators.html

How does a generator work?
 
Take a length of wire, hook it up to an ammeter (something that measures current), and place it between the poles of a magnet. Now move the wire sharply through the invisiblemagnetic field the magnet produces and a current will briefly flow through the wire (registering on the meter). This is the basic science behind the electricity generator, demonstrated in 1831 by British scientist Michael Faraday. If you move the wire in the opposite direction, you generate a current that flows the other way. (If you're interested, you can figure out the direction in which the current flows using something called theright-hand rule or generator rule, which is the mirror image of the left-hand rule used to figure out how motors work.)
The important thing to notice is that you generate a current only when you move the wire through the magnetic field (or when you move a magnet past a wire, which amounts to the same thing). It's not enough just to place a wire near a magnet: to generate electricity, either the wire has to move past the magnet or vice-versa. Suppose you want to generate lots of electricity. Lifting a wire up and down all day isn't going to be much fun—so you need to devise some way of moving a wire past a magnet by mounting one or the other of them on a wheel. Then, when you turn the wheel, the wire and magnet will move with respect to one another and an electric current will be produced.
Now here's the interesting part. Suppose you bend a wire into a loop, sit it between the poles of a magnet, and arrange it so it will constantly rotate—as in the diagram here. You can probably see that as you turn the loop, each side of the wire (either the orange side or the green side) will sometimes be moving up and sometimes moving down. When it's moving up, electricity will flow one way; when it's moving down, the current will flow the other way. So a basic generator like this will produce an electric current that reverses direction every time the loop of wire flips over (in other words, an alternating current or AC). However, most simple generators actually produce direct current—so how do they manage it?
Artwork: A simple generator like this produces alternating current (an electric current that periodically reverses). Each side of the generator (green or orange) is either moving up or down. When it moves up, it will generate a current flowing one way; when it moves down, the current flows the other way. If you're a meter connected to the wire, you don't know which way the wire is moving: all you see is that the direction of the current periodically reverses: you see an alternating current.
DC generators
 
Just as a simple DC electric motor uses direct current (DC) electricity to produce continual, rotary motion, so a simple DC generator produces a steady supply of direct current electricity when it spins around. Like a DC motor, a DC generator uses a commutator. It sounds technical, but it's just a metal ring with splits in it that periodically reverses the electrical contacts from the generator coil, reversing the current at the same time. As we saw up above, a simple loop of wire automatically reverses the current it produces every half-turn, simply because it's rotating, and the commutator's job is to cancel out the effect of the coil's rotation, ensuring that a direct current is produced.
AC Alternators
What if you want to generate alternating current (AC) instead of direct current? Then you need an alternator, which is simply an AC generator. The simplest kind of alternator is like a DC generator without a commutator. As the coil or magnets spin past one another, the current naturally rises, falls, and reverses, giving an AC output. Just as there are AC induction motors, which use electromagnets to produce a rotating magnetic field instead of permanent magnets, so there are alternators that work by induction in a similar way.
Alternators are mostly used for generating electricity from vehicle engines. Cars use alternators, driven by their gasoline engines, which charge up theirbatteries as they drive along (the AC current is converted to DC by diodes or rectifier circuits).

MOSFET
Equivalent circuit of BJT, JFET, MOSFET

The Field Effect Transistor, or simply FET however, uses the voltage that is applied to their input terminal, called the Gate to control the current flowing through them resulting in the output current being proportional to the input voltage. As their operation relies on an electric field (hence the name field effect) generated by the input Gate voltage, this then makes the Field Effect Transistor a “VOLTAGE” operated device.

As their name implies, Bipolar Transistors are “Bipolar” devices because they operate with both types of charge carriers, Holes and Electrons. The Field Effect Transistor on the other hand is a “Unipolar” device that depends only on the conduction of electrons (N-channel) or holes (P-channel).

Junction Field Effect Transistor
http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_5.html
Junction Field Effect Transistor
The Field Effect Transistor
In the Bipolar Junction Transistor  tutorials, we saw that the output Collector current of the transistor is proportional to input current flowing into the Base terminal of the device, thereby making the bipolar transistor a “CURRENT” operated device (Beta model) as a smaller current can be used to switch a larger load current.

The Field Effect Transistor, or simply FET however, uses the voltage that is applied to their input terminal, called the Gate to control the current flowing through them resulting in the output current being proportional to the input voltage. As their operation relies on an electric field (hence the name field effect) generated by the input Gate voltage, this then makes the Field Effect Transistor a “VOLTAGE” operated device.
 Typical Field Effect
Transistor
The Field Effect Transistor is a three terminal unipolar semiconductor device that has very similar characteristics to those of their Bipolar Transistor counterparts ie, high efficiency, instant operation, robust and cheap and can be used in most electronic circuit applications to replace their equivalent bipolar junction transistors (BJT) cousins.
Field effect transistors can be made much smaller than an equivalent BJT transistor and along with their low power consumption and power dissipation makes them ideal for use in integrated circuits such as the CMOS range of digital logic chips.
We remember from the previous tutorials that there are two basic types of bipolar transistor construction, NPN and PNP, which basically describes the physical arrangement of the P-type and N-type semiconductor materials from which they are made. This is also true of FET’s as there are also two basic classifications of Field Effect Transistor, called the N-channel FET and the P-channel FET.
The field effect transistor is a three terminal device that is constructed with no PN-junctions within the main current carrying path between the Drain and the Source terminals, which correspond in function to the Collector and the Emitter respectively of the bipolar transistor. The current path between these two terminals is called the “channel” which may be made of either a P-type or an N-type semiconductor material.
Related Products: RF MOSFET
The control of current flowing in this channel is achieved by varying the voltage applied to the Gate. As their name implies, Bipolar Transistors are “Bipolar” devices because they operate with both types of charge carriers, Holes and Electrons. The Field Effect Transistor on the other hand is a “Unipolar” device that depends only on the conduction of electrons (N-channel) or holes (P-channel).
The Field Effect Transistor has one major advantage over its standard bipolar transistor cousins, in that their input impedance, ( Rin ) is very high, (thousands of Ohms), while the BJT is comparatively low. This very high input impedance makes them very sensitive to input voltage signals, but the price of this high sensitivity also means that they can be easily damaged by static electricity.
There are two main types of field effect transistor, the Junction Field Effect Transistor or JFET and the Insulated-gate Field Effect Transistor or IGFET), which is more commonly known as the standard Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor or MOSFET for short.
The Junction Field Effect Transistor
We saw previously that a bipolar junction transistor is constructed using two PN-junctions in the main current carrying path between the Emitter and the Collector terminals. The Junction Field Effect Transistor (JUGFET or JFET) has no PN-junctions but instead has a narrow piece of high resistivity semiconductor material forming a “Channel” of either N-type or P-type silicon for the majority carriers to flow through with two ohmic electrical connections at either end commonly called the Drain and the Source respectively.
There are two basic configurations of junction field effect transistor, the N-channel JFET and the P-channel JFET. The N-channel JFET’s channel is doped with donor impurities meaning that the flow of current through the channel is negative (hence the term N-channel) in the form of electrons.
Likewise, the P-channel JFET’s channel is doped with acceptor impurities meaning that the flow of current through the channel is positive (hence the term P-channel) in the form of holes. N-channel JFET’s have a greater channel conductivity (lower resistance) than their equivalent P-channel types, since electrons have a higher mobility through a conductor compared to holes. This makes the N-channel JFET’s a more efficient conductor compared to their P-channel counterparts.
We have said previously that there are two ohmic electrical connections at either end of the channel called the Drain and the Source. But within this channel there is a third electrical connection which is called the Gate terminal and this can also be a P-type or N-type material forming a PN-junction with the main channel. The relationship between the connections of a junction field effect transistor and a bipolar junction transistor are compared below.
Comparison of Connections between a JFET and a BJT
Bipolar Transistor	Field Effect Transistor
Emitter – (E)     >>     Source – (S)
Base – (B)     >>     Gate – (G)
Collector – (C)     >>     Drain – (D)
The symbols and basic construction for both configurations of JFETs are shown below.
 

The semiconductor “channel” of the Junction Field Effect Transistor is a resistive path through which a voltage VDS causes a current ID to flow and as such the junction field effect transistor can conduct current equally well in either direction. As the channel is resistive in nature, a voltage gradient is thus formed down the length of the channel with this voltage becoming less positive as we go from the Drain terminal to the Source terminal.
The result is that the PN-junction therefore has a high reverse bias at the Drain terminal and a lower reverse bias at the Source terminal. This bias causes a “depletion layer” to be formed within the channel and whose width increases with the bias.
The magnitude of the current flowing through the channel between the Drain and the Source terminals is controlled by a voltage applied to the Gate terminal, which is a reverse-biased. In an N-channel JFET this Gate voltage is negative while for a P-channel JFET the Gate voltage is positive. The main difference between the JFET and a BJT device is that when the JFET junction is reverse-biased the Gate current is practically zero, whereas the Base current of the BJT is always some value greater than zero.
Biasing of an N-channel JFET
 
The cross sectional diagram above shows an N-type semiconductor channel with a P-type region called the Gate diffused into the N-type channel forming a reverse biased PN-junction and it is this junction which forms the depletion region around the Gate area when no external voltages are applied. JFETs are therefore known as depletion mode devices.
This depletion region produces a potential gradient which is of varying thickness around the PN-junction and restrict the current flow through the channel by reducing its effective width and thus increasing the overall resistance of the channel itself.
Then we can see that the most-depleted portion of the depletion region is in between the Gate and the Drain, while the least-depleted area is between the Gate and the Source. Then the JFET’s channel conducts with zero bias voltage applied (ie, the depletion region has near zero width).
With no external Gate voltage ( VG = 0 ), and a small voltage ( VDS ) applied between the Drain and the Source, maximum saturation current ( IDSS ) will flow through the channel from the Drain to the Source restricted only by the small depletion region around the junctions.
If a small negative voltage ( -VGS ) is now applied to the Gate the size of the depletion region begins to increase reducing the overall effective area of the channel and thus reducing the current flowing through it, a sort of “squeezing” effect takes place. So by applying a reverse bias voltage increases the width of the depletion region which in turn reduces the conduction of the channel.
Since the PN-junction is reverse biased, little current will flow into the gate connection. As the Gate voltage ( -VGS ) is made more negative, the width of the channel decreases until no more current flows between the Drain and the Source and the FET is said to be “pinched-off” (similar to the cut-off region for a BJT). The voltage at which the channel closes is called the “pinch-off voltage”, ( VP ).
JFET Channel Pinched-off
 
In this pinch-off region the Gate voltage, VGS controls the channel current and VDS has little or no effect.
 JFET Model
The result is that the FET acts more like a voltage controlled resistor which has zero resistance when VGS = 0 and maximum “ON” resistance ( RDS ) when the Gate voltage is very negative. Under normal operating conditions, the JFET gate is always negatively biased relative to the source.
It is essential that the Gate voltage is never positive since if it is all the channel current will flow to the Gate and not to the Source, the result is damage to the JFET. Then to close the channel:
•	No Gate voltage ( VGS ) and VDS is increased from zero.
•	No VDS and Gate control is decreased negatively from zero.
•	VDS and VGS varying.
The P-channel Junction Field Effect Transistor operates the same as the N-channel above, with the following exceptions: 1). Channel current is positive due to holes, 2). The polarity of the biasing voltage needs to be reversed.
The output characteristics of an N-channel JFET with the gate short-circuited to the source is given as
Output characteristic V-I curves of a typical junction FET.
 
The voltage VGS applied to the Gate controls the current flowing between the Drain and the Source terminals. VGS refers to the voltage applied between the Gate and the Source while VDS refers to the voltage applied between the Drain and the Source.
Because a Junction Field Effect Transistor is a voltage controlled device, “NO current flows into the gate!” then the Source current ( IS ) flowing out of the device equals the Drain current flowing into it and therefore ( ID = IS ).
The characteristics curves example shown above, shows the four different regions of operation for a JFET and these are given as:
•	Ohmic Region – When VGS = 0 the depletion layer of the channel is very small and the JFET acts like a voltage controlled resistor.
•	Cut-off Region – This is also known as the pinch-off region were the Gate voltage, VGS is sufficient to cause the JFET to act as an open circuit as the channel resistance is at maximum.
•	Saturation or Active Region – The JFET becomes a good conductor and is controlled by the Gate-Source voltage, ( VGS ) while the Drain-Source voltage, ( VDS ) has little or no effect.
•	Breakdown Region – The voltage between the Drain and the Source, ( VDS ) is high enough to causes the JFET’s resistive channel to break down and pass uncontrolled maximum current.
The characteristics curves for a P-channel junction field effect transistor are the same as those above, except that the Drain current ID decreases with an increasing positive Gate-Source voltage, VGS.
The Drain current is zero when VGS = VP. For normal operation, VGS is biased to be somewhere between VP and 0. Then we can calculate the Drain current, ID for any given bias point in the saturation or active region as follows:
Drain current in the active region.
 
Note that the value of the Drain current will be between zero (pinch-off) and IDSS(maximum current). By knowing the Drain current ID and the Drain-Source voltage VDSthe resistance of the channel ( ID ) is given as:
Drain-Source channel resistance.
 
Where: gm is the “transconductance gain” since the JFET is a voltage controlled device and which represents the rate of change of the Drain current with respect to the change in Gate-Source voltage.
Modes of FET’s
Like the bipolar junction transistor, the field effect transistor being a three terminal device is capable of three distinct modes of operation and can therefore be connected within a circuit in one of the following configurations.
Common Source (CS) Configuration
 
In the Common Source configuration (similar to common emitter), the input is applied to the Gate and its output is taken from the Drain as shown. This is the most common mode of operation of the FET due to its high input impedance and good voltage amplification and as such Common Source amplifiers are widely used.
The common source mode of FET connection is generally used audio frequency amplifiers and in high input impedance pre-amps and stages. Being an amplifying circuit, the output signal is 180o “out-of-phase” with the input.
Common Gate (CG) Configuration
 
In the Common Gate configuration (similar to common base), the input is applied to the Source and its output is taken from the Drain with the Gate connected directly to ground (0v) as shown. The high input impedance feature of the previous connection is lost in this configuration as the common gate has a low input impedance, but a high output impedance.
This type of FET configuration can be used in high frequency circuits or in impedance matching circuits were a low input impedance needs to be matched to a high output impedance. The output is “in-phase” with the input.
Common Drain (CD) Configuration
 
In the Common Drain configuration (similar to common collector), the input is applied to the Gate and its output is taken from the Source. The common drain or “source follower” configuration has a high input impedance and a low output impedance and near-unity voltage gain so is therefore used in buffer amplifiers. The voltage gain of the source follower configuration is less than unity, and the output signal is “in-phase”, 0o with the input signal.
This type of configuration is referred to as “Common Drain” because there is no signal available at the drain connection, the voltage present, +VDD just provides a bias. The output is in-phase with the input.
The JFET Amplifier
Just like the bipolar junction transistor, JFET’s can be used to make single stage class A amplifier circuits with the JFET common source amplifier and characteristics being very similar to the BJT common emitter circuit. The main advantage JFET amplifiers have over BJT amplifiers is their high input impedance which is controlled by the Gate biasing resistive network formed by R1 and R2 as shown.
Biasing of JFET Amplifier
 
This common source (CS) amplifier circuit is biased in class “A” mode by the voltage divider network formed by resistors R1 and R2. The voltage across the Source resistor RSis generally set to be about one quarter of VDD, ( VDD /4 ) but can be any reasonable value. The required Gate voltage can then be calculated from this RS value. Since the Gate current is zero, ( IG = 0 ) we can set the required DC quiescent voltage by the proper selection of resistors R1 and R2.
The control of the Drain current by a negative Gate potential makes the Junction Field Effect Transistor useful as a switch and it is essential that the Gate voltage is never positive for an N-channel JFET as the channel current will flow to the Gate and not the Drain resulting in damage to the JFET. The principals of operation for a P-channel JFET are the same as for the N-channel JFET, except that the polarity of the voltages need to be reversed.
In the next tutorial about Transistors, we will look at another type of Field Effect Transistor called a MOSFET whose Gate connection is completely isolated from the main current carrying channel.








Summary:
1. The BJT is a current-controlled device since its output is determined on the input current, while FET is considered as a voltage-controlled device, because it depends on the field effect of the applied voltage.
2. The BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) uses both the minority and majority carriers (holes and electrons), while FETs, which are sometimes called unipolar transistors, uses either holes or electrons for conduction.
